# Capstone Project Proposal

Please complete this project proposal thoroughly so that your instructors can review it and have an intelligent conversation with you about requirements, scope, feasiblity, etc. Proposals will be due by the end of day on Friday before capstones start. If you don't have your idea fully fleshed out, complete the portions of this you can so that an instructor can help you flesh out the rest of your idea.

## Problem Statement



## How will your project solve this problem?



## 5 user stories (at least):

* User will be prompted to sign up or login when entering page
* upon login, user will be sent to profile page, where users stats and objects collected are listed.
* User will be able to navigate between three screens - profile, map, and AR scene, using top navbar
* When user enters map screen, they will be able to interact with map, view current location, and view pinned virtual objects 
* Once close enough to object, user will be able to enter AR mode.
* Once in AR mode, user will be able to use camera to find virtual object. Once close enough to object, user will be able to pick up object.
* Upon picking up object, user's profile will be updated with object.

## What technologies do you plan to use?

This does not need to be an exhaustive list. We want you to identify major technologies you will be using. This list may grow or shrink as your project progresses.

* React-native
* ViroReact AR platform
* Node/Express server

## ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram

This does not need to be your absolute final ERD. We want you thinking about your data and how it might be related. Your ERD can be adjusted as your project progresses.
